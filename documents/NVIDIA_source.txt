“The next industrial revolution has begun — companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar
traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center — AI factories — to produce a new
commodity: artificial intelligence,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “AI will bring significant productivity
gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient, while expanding revenue
opportunities.
“Our data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the
Hopper platform. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies, and
enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.
“We are poised for our next wave of growth. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillionparameter-scale generative AI. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data
centers. And NVIDIA NIM is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade, optimized generative AI to run on
CUDA everywhere — from the cloud to on-prem data centers and RTX AI PCs — through our expansive network of
ecosystem partners.”
NVIDIA also announced a ten-for-one forward stock split of NVIDIA’s issued common stock to make stock ownership more
accessible to employees and investors. The split will be effected through an amendment to NVIDIA’s Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, which will result in a proportionate increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock. Each record
holder of common stock as of the close of market on Thursday, June 6, 2024, will receive nine additional shares of common
stock, to be distributed after the close of market on Friday, June 7, 2024. Trading is expected to commence on a splitadjusted basis at market open on Monday, June 10, 2024.
NVIDIA is increasing its quarterly cash dividend by 150% from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share of common stock. The
increased dividend is equivalent to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis and will be paid on Friday, June 28, 2024, to all
shareholders of record on Tuesday, June 11, 2024.
